                    <h2>What do we do?</h2>
                    <p>
                        We specialise in building high quality web applications.
                    </p>

                    <h3>What's a web application?</h3>
                    <p>Software that runs within your browser like a website.</p>
                    <h3>Why build and use web applications?</h3>
                    <p>There are many benefits in building and using web applications as opposed
                    to desktop applications:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>Quicker and cheaper to develop than desktop applications</p></li>
                        <li><p>Works on all operating systems with a web browser</p></li>
                        <li><p>Mobile ready; no need to develop applications for
                            Android and iOS</p></li>
                        <li><p>No need to install new software on your computers</p></li>
                        <li><p>Access it from anywhere in the world. When your application
                            is hosted in the cloud, you can use it anywhere you have
                            internet access.</p></li>

                        We believe in creating high quality applications.

                    <p>
                        We don't jump straight into building your application without
                        careful planning and investigation into an optimal solution.

                    <p>
                        We work with you to best understand your current problem and
                        we can design a solution which is cost-effective and user-friendly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We won't leave you in the dark; we'll walk through the processes with you.

                        We do the following instead:

                        <li><p>Identify who will use your application</p></li>
                        <li><p>Determine how they will use the application</p></li>
                        <li><p>Explore possible pain/confusion points in your application</p></li>
                        <li><p>Develop designs which fix the pain/confusion points</p></li>
                        <li><p>You end up with happy users</p></li>
